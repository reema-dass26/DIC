Dic exercise 2



I have worked on Part 1 and part 2 of the exercise. Reported briefly about both the tasks in an overleaf report. the link to that is here:

As i mentioned in the group i wasnt sure how else to proceed with the report, I did based on what I could interpret.

I see that part 3 overlaps o part 2, it can be reused, I will try to work on part 3 today a bit. but i hope you guys can take it forward.
